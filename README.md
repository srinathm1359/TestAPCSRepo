## Demo.java
Demo.java is a program taking at most one input parameter. Demo.java prints a triangle pattern based on an input parameter n, which is a positive integer. 
Demo.java starts by printing 1 n times in the first row, 2 n-1 times in the second row, and so on, until n is printed by itself in the last row. If there is no input parameter, it defaults to 5. 

For example, java Demo 3 outputs: 

111

22

3

On the other hand, java Demo outputs:

11111

2222

333

44

5
